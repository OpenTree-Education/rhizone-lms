# `webapp`

The `webapp` module was scaffolded from
[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you are using the right version of Node and Yarn. If you have `nvm`,
   run `nvm use`. To install Yarn globally for the current managed version of
   Node, run `npm install --global yarn`.
2. Install project dependencies with `yarn install`.
3. Run the development server with `yarn develop`.
