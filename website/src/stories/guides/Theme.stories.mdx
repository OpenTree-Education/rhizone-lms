# Theme

The CSS of this site comes from [Material UI](https://mui.com/) and therefore
all changes to the overall typography and colours of the site should be made in
an idiomatic way for that library.

The configuration for the theme is in `src/components/theme.ts`, and adheres to
the [Theming documentation](https://mui.com/customization/theming/) for Material
UI. After any new modifications to the theme are made, all pages must be checked
to ensure that the changes didn't cause any regressions or unintended side
effects.
