# Posts

Posts are [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files with
[Frontmatter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/routing/adding-markdown-pages/#frontmatter-for-metadata-in-markdown-files)
in the `src/posts` directory that are published as blog posts under `/blog` on
the website.

## Creating a new post

Creating a post is done when the article is fully written and ready to be
published. After the Markdown of the post is ready to be published, the
following steps will add it to the website.

### Naming the file

The name of the post file is only used to help identify the file in the folder.
Use lowercase letters, numbers, and separate words with hyphens in order to be
consistent. The file must be named with the `.md` extension and placed in the
`src/content/posts` directory.

### Post level properties

The post level properties are added as Frontmatter and are documented in the
[**Components / Post**](?path=/story/components-post--post) story. For example:

```markdown
---
title: Blog Post Title
subtitle: Subtitle of the Blog Post
publicationDate: 2022-01-02
author: Author Name
slug: blog-post-title-subtitle-of-the-blog-post
---
```

## Writing the post

The Markdown of the post itself can be pasted after the Frontmatter. To preview
the post on the development server, type the slug into the location after
`/blog/`.

## Adding the post to the index

At the time of writing, the blog post index is hard coded on the
`src/content/pages/blog.yml` page. When publishing a new blog post, copy and
paste an existing index entry and modify it with content pertaining to the new
post.
