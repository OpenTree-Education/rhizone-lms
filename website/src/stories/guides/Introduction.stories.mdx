# Introduction

These guides go over how to create and edit pages and blog posts on the website.
All the pages on the website are automatically generated by
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/) based on files in the `src/content`
directory of this project.

## Website pages

The `src/content/pages` directory contains Yaml files that are transformed into
regular website pages. See
[**Guides / Pages**](?path=/story/guides-pages--page) for more information.

## Blog posts

The `src/content/posts` directory contains Markdown files that are transformed
into blog posts. See [**Guides / Posts**](?path=/story/guides-posts--page) for
more information.

## Style guide

When editing the website, make sure you're adhering to the appropriate style
guides.

Broad changes to typography, etc., should be made to the theme, as described in
[**Guides / Theme**](?path=/story/guides-theme--page).

## Moving or deleting pages

If a page or post needs to be moved to a new path or deleted, a special process
should be followed to preserve SEO and prevent breaking links coming from other
sites. See [**Guides / Redirects**](?path=/story/guides-redirects--page) for
more information.

## Modifying components

Components may need to be modified to add features, like to make part of a page
more configurable. There is a common process to do that which is described in
[**Guides / Adding features**](?path=/story/guides-adding-features--page).
