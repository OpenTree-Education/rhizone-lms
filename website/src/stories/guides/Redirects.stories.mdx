# Redirects

The website is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) which supports
creating web page redirects by adding a file named `_redirects` in the website
files. See their documentation on using
[`_redirects`](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/).

The `_redirects` for this website can be found in the `static` directory.

Redirects might need to be added if the path of a page or post changes, a page
or post is deleted, or a short URL should be redirected to a longer one.

## Moving or deleting a post or page

The most common reason to create a redirect is if a page needs to be moved or
deleted. For example, if the Professional Mentorship Program is rebranded, the
page path might need to be updated in a way that doesn't break any external
links. If the program is changed to the Foo Bar Program and the path to the page
is changed to `/foo-bar-program`, then a line should be added to the
`_redirects` file that looks like the following.

```
/professional-mentorship-program /foo-bar-program
```

Once the website is deployed, requests for `/professional-mentorship-program`
will be redirected to `/foo-bar-program`, so it's important that upon deploying,
there is _no page_ at the old path (`/professional-mentorship-program`) and
there _is_ a page at the new path (`/foo-bar-program`). This will happen
naturally with pages when the YAML file in `src/content/pages` is renamed or the
`slug` property of a post is changed.

Care should be taken to avoid having both the old and new page or post exist at
the same time, otherwise an inaccessible page will remain in the website and the
build time of the site will suffer. Furthermore, the metadata used to preload
links will be inaccurate and may result in unpredictable behaviour on the site.
